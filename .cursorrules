# MasonEffect Package Rules for AI Agents

When working with the MasonEffect package, AI agents should:

1. **Always read AI_SETUP_GUIDE.md first** before installing or using this package
2. **Detect environment automatically** by checking package.json for framework, TypeScript, and build tool
3. **Use direct import paths** for tree-shaking (e.g., `masoneffect/react/textToParticle` not `masoneffect`)
4. **Recommend appropriate effect** based on user request keywords
5. **Generate framework-specific code** using templates from AI_SETUP_GUIDE.md

Reference: See AI_SETUP_GUIDE.md for complete setup instructions.
